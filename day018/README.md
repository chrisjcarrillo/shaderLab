SVG + shaders in THREE<br>
My roommate (her name is Green) is leaving and so I made a shader for her today. I started by writing her name in cursive in Illustrator (huge challenge tbh) and save as SVG. Then I put that SVG into my Three.js sketch and convert it to tubeGeometry which I then wrapped my shader around it.
